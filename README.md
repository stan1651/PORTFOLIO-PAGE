# PORTFOLIO-PAGE
The motivation for this project was to create an easy to read artistic portfolio page where prospective clients, or even anyone just interested, could view a representation of my work and also that i could update periodically to show progress and maturing of my work.
the difficult part for me is always the CSS which i have not updated as of yet.
